	* A wall jump occurs when the player presses jump button next to a wall while not on standing on ground,
	* the player is forced to travel upwards and opposite to the wall for a short while, before regaining
	* air control.
	*
	* In this implementation, a full wall jump is separated into lateral motion and Z motion.  While the 
	* execution of occurs at same time, their duration differs and lateral motion can't be controlled.

	* NOTE: We MUST be able to hold jump key for longer jump in order for wall jump to make sense
